# üìä GTECH EMR ‚Äì Admin Dashboard & Analytics

The Admin Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the EMR system's data in real time. This document outlines the key features, interactions, and underlying functionality of the admin panel.

## üß© Core Features

### 1. **Dashboard Metrics**
- **Total Patients:** Displays the current count of all registered patients.
- **Total Doctors:** Shows the total number of doctors in the system.
- **Total Appointments:** Lists all scheduled appointments.
- **Lab Reports Today:** Counts lab test reports generated on the current day.

### 2. **Dynamic Trend Chart**
- **Appointments Over Time:** A line chart that plots the number of appointments per day.
- **Customizable Date Range:** The chart uses dynamic filters that allow the admin to specify a custom start and end date.
- **Interactive Data Updates:** Dashboard refreshes analytics based on filtering criteria like patient ID, doctor ID, and date range.

### 3. **Filter Controls**
- **Optional Filters:** Admins can filter data by:
  - **Patient ID:** Enter a specific patient ID to narrow down results.
  - **Doctor ID:** Enter a specific doctor ID for focused analytics.
  - **Date Range:** Choose custom start and end dates to view trends within that period.
- **Flexible Query Parameters:** Filters are individually optional. The system accepts:
  - Patient ID only
  - Doctor ID only
  - Date range only
  - Combinations of all three

### 4. **Export to PDF**
- **One-Click PDF Generation:** Users can export the current view of the admin dashboard to a PDF.
- **Includes All Key Metrics:** The PDF report features the total counts, detailed trend chart data, and any applied filters.
- **Client-Side Implementation:** The export is performed using `jsPDF` on the frontend for real-time, on-demand reporting.

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend (Node.js / Express):
- **API Endpoint:**  
  `GET /api/admin/dashboard`  
  This endpoint returns an aggregated JSON object containing:
  - `totalPatients`
  - `totalDoctors`
  - `totalAppointments`
  - `labReportsToday`
  - `trends`: An array with objects representing each day‚Äôs appointment count, filtered by any query parameters sent.
- **Query Customization:**  
  The endpoint supports optional query parameters (`patientId`, `doctorId`, `startDate`, `endDate`) to dynamically filter the trend data:
  - Example:  
    `GET /api/admin/dashboard?patientId=1001&startDate=2024-05-01&endDate=2024-05-30`
- **SQL Optimization:**  
  Leveraging subqueries and filtering using `WHERE` clauses ensures that count statistics are retrieved optimally. The query consolidates metrics and chart data, providing a single response object that the frontend can interpret.

### Frontend (React):
- **AdminDashboard.jsx:**  
  - Uses Axios to fetch data from `/api/admin/dashboard` and binds it to state.
  - Displays key metrics in card-style UI components.
  - Renders a responsive line chart (or bar chart if preferred) using Chart.js (`react-chartjs-2`) to display appointment trends.
  - Provides dynamic filter inputs for `patientId`, `doctorId`, and a custom date range (`startDate` and `endDate`) to update the dashboard data.
  - Includes a "Export to PDF" button that triggers PDF generation using `jsPDF`, capturing the current dashboard view.
- **Interactivity:**  
  - When an admin updates any filter input and submits the form, the dashboard automatically refetches and updates the display.
  - The PDF export function respects the current filters, ensuring that the report reflects exactly what is seen on the dashboard.

## üìà Future Enhancements & Suggestions

1. **Real-time Updates:**  
   Implement WebSocket or polling functionality to update dashboard metrics automatically without manual refresh.

2. **Data Drill-Down:**  
   Enable clickable metrics or chart data points that lead to detailed reports or patient/appointment lists for deeper analysis.

3. **Visual Enhancements:**  
   Consider using a UI component library (e.g., Material UI or Chakra UI) for a more polished and consistent dashboard look.

4. **Role-Based Access:**  
   Introduce different admin levels (e.g., Super Admin, Department Admin) to manage data visibility and editing capabilities.

5. **Export Customization:**  
   Provide options to export data in CSV or Excel format, in addition to PDFs.
